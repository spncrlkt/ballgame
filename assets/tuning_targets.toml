# Tuning Targets for Game Balance
#
# These targets define the ideal game metrics we're aiming for.
# The analyze tool compares simulation results against these targets
# and suggests parameter changes to help reach them.

[targets]
# Average score per player per match (left + right should average ~28 total)
avg_score = { target = 14.0, tolerance = 1.0 }

# Average score difference between winner and loser
# Lower = closer matches, higher = more blowouts
score_differential = { target = 2.0, tolerance = 1.0 }

# Target match duration in seconds (3 minutes)
match_duration_secs = { target = 180.0, tolerance = 15.0 }

# Turnovers per match (steals + dropped balls)
# Creates back-and-forth gameplay without being frustrating
turnovers_per_match = { target = 20.0, tolerance = 5.0 }

# Missed shots per match
# Balance between skill expression and scoring opportunity
missed_shots_per_match = { target = 20.0, tolerance = 5.0 }
