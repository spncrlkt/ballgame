# Art Direction & Theme

## Era & Aesthetic

**Foundation:** 14th-17th century materials and craftsmanship
**Accents:** 18th century magic and early technology

## Material Palette

| Category | Materials |
|----------|-----------|
| Structural | Wood, stone, iron, brass |
| Soft | Leather, cloth, rope, canvas |
| Magic | Subtle glows, alchemical symbols, enchanted bindings |
| Tech | Clockwork, brass mechanisms, glass lenses |

## Visual Language

- Handcrafted aesthetic: visible stitching, rivets, wood grain, forge marks
- Warm, earthy tones with metallic accents
- Magic is subtle, not flashy - glows and shimmers, not explosions
- Technology feels mechanical and tangible, not sleek

## Color Philosophy

**Theme:** Mesoamerican ancient stone/sky meets earthen clay

### Team Colors: Turquoise vs Terracotta

| Team | Primary | Dark (rims) |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Left | Turquoise `(0.25, 0.75, 0.8)` - sky/water/jade | Deep teal `(0.1, 0.4, 0.45)` |
| Right | Terracotta `(0.8, 0.45, 0.3)` - earth/clay/fire | Burnt clay `(0.5, 0.25, 0.15)` |

### Arena Colors

| Element | Color | RGB |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Background | Dark warm stone | `(0.15, 0.13, 0.12)` |
| Floor/Platforms | Weathered stone | `(0.35, 0.32, 0.28)` |

### UI/Text Colors

| Use | Color | RGB |
|-----|-------|-----|
| Primary text | Bone white/cream | `(0.95, 0.9, 0.8)` |
| Secondary text | Aged parchment | `(0.7, 0.65, 0.55)` |
| Accent/highlight | Gold/amber | `(0.9, 0.75, 0.4)` |

### Contrast Notes
- Rims use opposing team's dark color for visual contrast
- Both team colors pop against dark stone background
- Bone white text readable on all backgrounds
- Ball uses hexagon pattern with both team colors + black seams

## Element Design Notes

### Ball
- Hexagon-patterned leather (soccer ball style)
- Turquoise + terracotta panels alternating
- Black stitched seams between panels
- Magical glow on pickup (gold tint pulse + size pulse)

### Baskets
- Wooden frame with rope netting (future)
- Rims in opposing team's dark color (contrast)
- Could have brass reinforcement rings

### Players
- Period-appropriate athletic wear
- Team colors with leather/cloth textures
- Could have magical armband or amulet

### Arena
- Stone and wood platforms
- Iron/brass fixtures
- Torch or lantern lighting aesthetic

## Future Considerations & Brainstorm

### Mesoamerican Ball Game Influence

**Historical elements (ullamaliztli/pok-ta-pok):**
- Stone court architecture with sloped walls
- Vertical stone rings as goals (not horizontal baskets)
- Rubber ball - could inform bounce physics feel
- Ritual/ceremonial significance - high stakes
- Elaborate player gear: yokes, handstones, padding

**Visual hooks:**
- Carved stone reliefs on arena walls
- Jade and obsidian accents
- Feathered elements (quetzal, eagle)
- Serpent motifs (Quetzalcoatl)
- Sun/moon/calendar iconography
- Blood sacrifice undertones (score = survival?)

### Bloodborne Aesthetic Fusion

**Gothic Victorian horror:**
- Ornate but weathered and decaying
- Wrought iron, cobblestone, gaslight
- Blood moon atmosphere
- Trick weapon mechanical complexity
- Hunter attire: long coats, tricorn hats, wrapped limbs
- Beasts and eldritch corruption lurking

**Thematic elements:**
- The Hunt as sport/ritual
- Cosmic horror undertones (Old Ones watching?)
- Blood echoes = points?
- Insight/madness mechanics potential
- Chalice dungeon procedural arenas
- Dream/nightmare realm transitions

### Mashup Possibilities

**"The Blood Court"** - Arena concept:
- Ancient Mesoamerican stone court
- Victorian gothic additions: iron gates, gaslight torches
- Carved serpents with mechanical brass eyes
- Stone rings wrapped in bloodstained cloth
- Spectators in hunter garb and beast masks

**Ball design evolution:**
- Core: Ancient rubber/leather construction
- Enhancement: Brass clockwork binding
- Corruption: Pulsing with inner blood-light
- Final form: Eye of an Old One (it watches back)

**Player archetypes:**
- The Hunter: Trick weapon reach, mobility
- The Scholar: Insight-based abilities, fragile
- The Beast: Strength, aggression, transformation
- The Pthumerian: Ancient, ritualistic, blood arts

**Arena hazards (future features):**
- Blood pools that empower or corrupt
- Emerging beast limbs from shadows
- Stone serpents that activate on score
- Eclipse events changing rules mid-match

**Audio/atmosphere:**
- Distant chanting (Mesoamerican drums + gothic choir)
- Mechanical clicking of brass mechanisms
- Beast howls echoing from beyond the walls
- Heartbeat intensifying near goal

### Tone Spectrum

```
Calcio Storico -------- Current -------- Blood Court
(historical sport)     (arcade)         (ritual horror)

Light                                    Dark
Competitive                              Desperate
Glory                                    Survival
```
